*Contain*(_er_) (_Den_)*izen*(_s_)

== Presentation or Coffee?

== Container

MicroOS FileSystems supported by Minimal HyperVisors.

=== Denizen

"`a person, animal, or plant that lives or is found in a particular place`"

=== Code of Conduct

* CNCF Architecture
* 12 Factor Compliance
* Container = Production Candidate
* GitOps
** Code Quality
** Vulnerability Scanning
** Config / Secret
* Continua

=== Continua

Gradual increase of environmental complexity until it is indistinguishable from actual _production_

== InfoSec Synergy

=== Target State

* Red: (Offensive Security) @ Security
** An actual _Black Box_
* Blue: (Defensive Security) @ Operations
** Vulnerability & Configuration Management
* Yellow: (Builders) @ Development
** _Crafted Code_ to be proud of

=== via Container(s)

Containers encapsulate the deployment and runtime, and large portion of security requirements of software into an aggregated, common & mostly reproducible environment.

== Why Use Containers?

===  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

*Works On My Machine...*

https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program/[WOMM Certification Program] is available!

[%conceal]
=== WOMM cont

IT organizations have come up with two broad approaches to solving this problem:

1. Make the development environment look more like production
2. Make production look more like the development environment

=== Orthodoxy

"`Development looks like Production`"

* Production => Dev data https://www.sqlshack.com/using-production-data-testing-post-gdpr-world/[Illegal via GDPR]
* Secret Management
* Restricted API Limits
* Stingy Resource Allocation


=== Insurgency

"`Production looks like Development`"

* Red Team:
** *Party!* https://youtu.be/wSqFqhUzutg[Tripod: 'Gonna Make you Happy!']
* Blue Team:
** _everyone, please observe a moment of silence_
* Yellow Team:
** _hail_ your new 24x7x365 System Overlords...

*history of failure..*

=== Constraint #1

[%step]
* cloning disks/images/VMs is time-consuming and expensive
* Containers:
** 'My Machine <==> Production'
** via *Golden Image*

=== Constraint #2

[%step]
* Constraint #2: Applications aren’t ready
* Architecture: Retire
** DDD
** N-Tier
* Architecture: Embrace
** C4 Model & arc42
** CNCF

== Container Technology

=== Key differences LXC / Docker

=== Kernel: Linux

* Host OS provides
** Irrelevant for _Container_
** mnt, uts, ipc, pid & net managed via _RunC_

=== Linux Kernel Dependencies

=== Union File System: OverlayFS

* Upper -> Lower
* Modifications
** Copy lower -> upper
* Deletes
** File: _whiteout_ in OverlayFS
** Directory: _opaque directory_ in OverlayFS

[%conceal]
=== UFS

image::https://www.datalight.com/assets/blog-images/OverlayFS_Image.png[background, size=contain]

=== FUSE: LXCFS

* Alternative to Union File System
* Possible to https://dzone.com/articles/kubernetes-demystified-using-lxcfs-to-improve-cont[deploy] in Kubernetes
** Debian || CentOS
** https://github.com/lxc/lxcfs/issues/289[Impossible on Alpine]

=== CGroups

* accounting
* controlling
* prioritization
* resource limiting

== Conflicts

=== Conflicts...

* Container != Virtual Machine
* Container > Application Virtualization
* Application Virtualization is *now* the problem
* Anything creating a closely bound architecture abstraction layer

=== Conflicts...

https://play.google.com/music/m/T3mb4rgjkr34cuygokjbih7hbf4?t=My_Old_Friend_-_Country_Karaoke_Cow_Boys[My 'old' friend JAVA]

* OpenJDK / JVM Anything
** Requires 1 machine per JVM
** Memory Leak between System & Application layers
** Pretends the container doesn't exist
** Hard wired to a specific OS folder structure

=== Conflicts...

* NodeJS... (what!)
* Ruby
* Mono
* C#
* ...

https://linuxcontainers.org/lxcfs/introduction/[LXCFS] seeks to address these issue.

[.notes]
--
* NodeJS fortunately the vast majority of what's done with this language never encounters this issue

== Language Affinity

=== Speed & Memory

1. C/C++
2. https://dlang.org[D]
3. https://nim-lang.org/[*Nim*] <= Recommended
4. https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust]

https://github.com/frol/completely-unscientific-benchmarks[Unscientific Benchmarks]

=== Shortlist

* Python (https://www.zerynth.com/blog/the-rise-of-python-for-embedded-systems/[Embedded Systems])
* Nim
* NodeJS
* Go (Cloud Only)

=== How to Choose?

* Adopt the RoR style of development (╥﹏╥)
* Rapid prototype in the language of choice
* Swap out critical / high throughput parts for Nim as needed

== The Base Container

=== Requirements

* Process Zombie
* OS Level Health Check
* Base Image
* Layer Caching

== Process Zombie

* https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init#why-you-need-an-init-system[Why You Need an Init System (Yelp)]
** No Signal Support in your App = Zombie
* SystemD is basically bloat ware in a container
* Options:
** https://github.com/krallin/tini[Tini]
** https://github.com/Yelp/dumb-init[Dumb-Init]
** https://skarnet.org/software/execline/dieshdiedie.html[S6] <= Recommended

=== S6: Execline

* Designed for _Embedded Systems_
* No overhead due to interactive support
* Occupied resources by Execline are instantly freed after task (irrespective of App execution)
* Statically compiled, minimal C dependencies
* Kernel Forking isn't an issue
* Fastest launch time of any Init Manager (Faster than sh)

https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay[JustContainers S6 version]

=== S6: Services

* Notifications
* onStart
* onFinish
* deathTally (ddos prevention)

http://skarnet.org/software/s6/servicedir.html[servicedir]

== OS Level Health Check

* NVMe can timeout!
** ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17099094[NVMe Update 2018]
* https://github.com/SimonBaeumer/goss/blob/master/docs/manual.md[Goss] validates everything outside your App
** Goss provides the 'healthz' endpoint for Kubernetes
** Separate Kernel branch reduces NodeJS loop overloading

https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/cvlka9/created_a_fork_of_goss_simple_and_easy_server/[Maintainer Update Info]

== Base Image

* *Must* compile on all all Chipsets
* _Just_
** Language dependencies
** Non-Zero User
** Zombie Manager
** Other Requirements

== Layer Caching

* *Not* important:
** Number of Layers... 125 maximum
* Important:
** Build Time
** Startup Time
** Network Utilization
** Update Propagation Time

=== Layer Caching...

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/tayloredtechnology/image/upload/e_bgremoval,q_auto/v1568906654/foggyubiquity.com/bash.jpg[background, size=contain]

=== Layer Caching...

* Content addressable
** *do not* need relationships to eachother
* DockerFile's are typically written
** _with relationships between layers in mind_
** Relationships = Vulnerability?

[%conceal]
=== Layer Caching...

duplicate nodes in the graph so each node is only pointed to once

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/tayloredtechnology/image/upload/e_bgremoval,q_auto/v1568906205/foggyubiquity.com/bash-weighted-step1.jpg[weighted]

[%conceal]
=== Layer Caching...

replace each leaf node with a counter, starting at 1

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/tayloredtechnology/image/upload/e_bgremoval,q_auto/v1568906346/foggyubiquity.com/bash-weighted-step2.jpg[leaf nodes]

[%conceal]
=== Layer Caching...

combine counters with their children, and their children’s counters summed, then incremented

image::https://res.cloudinary.com/tayloredtechnology/image/upload/e_bgremoval,q_auto/v1568906429/foggyubiquity.com/bash-weighted-step3.jpg[combine]

[%conceal]
=== Layer Caching...

repeat this process until there is only one node & sort by popularity & by name
