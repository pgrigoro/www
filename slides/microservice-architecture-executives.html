These same entities are represented in the form of circles that can overlap with each other, and which have the particularity of being self-organizing while being managed by the upper circle. Each circle is thus very responsive to change in its nature and composition. The gains observed by this type of management are the involvement, cooperation, and simplicity of the links between people.</p></div></aside></section><section id="_holacracy_2"><div class="imageblock" style=""><img src="https://adriancolyer.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/deathstarbench-fig-18.jpeg?w=480&h=489&zoom=2" alt="Holacracy Microservices"></div></section><section id="_additional_points"><h2>Additional Points</h2><div class="paragraph"><p>In the original Amazon architecture, a bug fix to the recommendation service would require changing some C++ in the monolithic application, waiting for other groups to complete their respective changes to the monolithic application, and testing the entire application for release.

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>TCO</strong></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>“[Microservices’] benefits generally yield a lower TCO due to optimized infrastructure spend as well as more efficient implementations given the reduced risk. [But] IT organizations are generally more interested in how they can reduce risk while continuing to innovate and exceed business stakeholder needs,” Bingham notes. “A solid microservices foundation allows for a bedrock of that innovation without sacrificing stability and scale. Business stakeholders want to get more benefit from their technology investment. Microservices enable a reduction in technology cost while also affording opportunities to parallelize efforts across microservices to more rapidly achieve business outcomes.”</p></div></section></section></div></div><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reveal.js/3.8.0/lib/js/head.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reveal.js/3.8.0/js/reveal.js"></script><script>Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('.slides section')).forEach(function(slide) {
