= Kubernetes on Metal

== Why do This?

* Performance
* Cost Savings!
* Reliance on Hardware Accelerators
** Field Programmable Gate Array (FGPM)
** Intel Optimizations
** Multiple Graphics Cards
* Ingress on Metal: Dynamic / AB / Canary

=== Kubernetes Illusion

=== Kubernetes Reality

"Kubernetes... eliminates the need for orchestration... (it) is composed of a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state" -- https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/[What is Kubernetes]

=== Containers

Containers are https://linuxcontainers.org/lxcfs/introduction/[LXCFS] MicroOS' on Minimal HyperVisors.

=== MicroServices

"`Simply the ability for each of your development teams to work on an independently shippable unit of code`"

Or, in technical terms:

// "`An architecture for the distributed development of cloud applications`"
"`An architecture for the distributed development of applications`"

=== Serverless

'pay-as-you-goâ€™ approach via distributed, short-lived, eventually executed applications

=== Interaction

https://www.saltstack.com/[Salt], https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible], & https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] are all typically used for Cloud Native Provisioning.

Terraform is the only one _trustable_ enough to be controlled by Kubernetes as it _just_ provisions

* _Official_ Cloud Provider
* Requires Project Atomic
** Micro Server Management = Way of Life

* Project Atomic requires micromanagement

* Needs 1 DHCP Server per Subnet
* iPXE boot enabled on machines
* Terraform support
** Filtering & Selecting Machines

== Minimal Decisions

=== Tenancy

* Only run Kubernetes for _Single Tenants_
* Kubernetes requires a *massive* overhaul for Multi Tenant support
** Use separate clusters meshed together if really necessary

=== Installer

*Installer != Distribution*

* _Gotcha:_ CNCF mislabels some distributions as installers.
* Contain only the essentials to start & upgrade Kubernetes
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/[KubeADM] is the most advanced.

=== Components

* Backups: https://github.com/openebs/velero-plugin[OpenEBS + Velero]
* (DNS) Domain Name Service
** Internal: https://coredns.io/[CoreDNS]
** External: https://coredns.io/[CoreDNS] || https://www.consul.io/docs/platform/k8s/dns.html[Consul DNS]
* Ingress: https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/kubernetes/ingress-controller/[Skipper]
* Logging: https://logdna.com/[LogDNA (Hosted)]
* Metrics: https://sysdig.com/products/monitor/[SysDig Monitor (Hosted)]

* Networking
** Hosts: https://vyos.io/[VyOS (BGP)] (or alternative)
* NodePort Load Balancing: http://gobetween.io/[gobetween]

=== Non-Hosted Alternatives

* Logging: https://grafana.com/oss/loki[Loki] & https://grafana.com/[Grafana]
* Metrics: https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] & https://grafana.com/[Grafana]
* Monitoring: https://sysdig.com/opensource/[SysDig Open Source] is a viable option for DIY affectionados

== Maximal Decisions

=== Maximal

* Container Certification: https://sysdig.com/use-cases/continuous-security/[SysDig Secure (Hosted)]
* Certificate Management: https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/[Cert Manager] + either https://www.venafi.com/blog/oh-how-i-love-my-hashi-vault[Venafi (Hosted) & Vault] || https://letsencrypt.org/[Lets Enrypt]

=== Maximal 2

* Continuous Integration: https://skaffold.dev/docs/[Skaffold] || https://brigade.sh/[Brigade] + https://github.com/sotekton/agnostic-basal/[Agnostic: Basal] -- NixOS totally cloud independent
* Application Definition: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize[Kustomize] || https://helm.sh/[Helm] -- not recommended

* https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/[Google Cloud Build]
** https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/getting_started_deploy.md[Prow (Self-Hosted GCB)] -- requires GitHub
--

=== Why no Envoy / Istio?

* Istio is an independent ecosystem
** Kubernetes is hard, but standardized
** Istio is another complex interface & technology
* BPF & IPv6 > Envoy functionality
* mTLS is redundant if not multi-tenant.
** CNI already transparently encrypts Node 2 Node traffic

=== Non-Hosted Alternatives

* Container Certification: https://sysdig.com/opensource/[SysDig Open Source] & https://anchore.com/enterprise/[Anchore]
* Certificate Management: No Open Source alternative to Venafi
* Cluster Security: https://falco.org/[SysDig Falco]
* Cluster Compliance: https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench[Kube Bench (CIS Kubernetes Benchmark)] & https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter[Kube Hunter]

== Augmented Decisions

* Automatic Vault Tokens: https://github.com/Boostport/kubernetes-vault[Vault Tokens]
* Container Isolation: https://katacontainers.io/[KataContainers]
* Governance & Dependency Management: https://www.cyvive.com/[Cyvive]

== Opportunity Costs

=== Cluster Management

* Time:
** Continual
* People:
** 3 per cluster

=== (DIY) Do it Yourself

* Time:
** approx 15 months
* People:
** 5+ ongoing

=== Certified Distribution

* Time:
** approx 12 months
** rolling tail of 12 months
* People:
** 3 + support
** rolling tail: 10+

=== (CaaS) Container as a Service

* Time:
** approx 1 month
** rolling tail: 10% time
* People: Developers + Operations

https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode[No Code] -- Kelsey Hightower's view

[.notes]
--
* Much duplication and custom internal management
--

=== Hire a Helper

* Time:
** within 3 months DevTest
** within 6 months Production
* People
** 1 Helper
** rolling tail: 1-2 days every quarter

*No Substitute for Experience*

=== Operational Platform

* Time:
** within 1 week DevTest
** within 1 month Production
** rolling tail: 1% time Developers
* People
** 1 per cloud (Metal / Public)

=== Operational Platform Includes

* Better Scheduler
* Configuration Management
* Continuous Delivery
* Data Center Replacement
* Dependency Management
* Federation of Clusters
* Governance
