**Today is the first and the last**. The last day of existing entirely in the ether of cyberspace researching, developing and understanding the absolute edge of technolgy. The first day of bringing that life into the tangible, real existence of leaving footprints for others to follow.

The MeetUp Group: [The Foggy Cloud (Brisbane)](https://www.meetup.com/The-Foggy-Cloud/) has been formed. Sponsored by our good friends at [Michael Page](https://www.michaelpage.com.au/). This group in conjunction with this website provides an enabling platform for all of us to rapidly adopt and embrace a ubiquitous lifestyle, while providing a community of knowledge to bring development into the Foggy Cloud Era
